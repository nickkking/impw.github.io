s() is used for univariate smooths (section 5.3, p. 201), isotropic smooths of  
several variables (section 5.5, 214) and random effects (section 3.5.2, 154).  
te() is used to specify tensor product smooths constructed from any singly  
penalized marginal smooths usable with s(), according to section 5.6 (p.  
227). Examples are provided in sections 7.2.3, 7.4 and 7.7.1, for example.  
ti() is used to specify tensor product interactions with the marginal smooths  
(and their lower order interactions) excluded, facilitating smooth ANOVA  
models as discussed in section 5.6.3 (p. 232), and exemplified in section  
7.3.  
t2() is used to specify the alternative tensor product smooth construction  
discussed in section 5.6.5 (p. 235), which is especially useful for  
generalized additive mixed modelling with the gamm4 package described in  
section 7.7.  
The first arguments to all these functions are the covariates of the smooth.  
Some further arguments control the details of the smoother. The most important  
are  
bs is a short character string specifying the type of basis. e.g. "cr" for
cubic  
regression spline, "ds" for Duchon spline, etc. It may be a vector in the  
tensor product case, if different types of basis are required for different  
marginals.  
k is the basis dimension, or marginal basis dimension (tensor case). It can
also  
be a vector in the tensor case, specifying a dimension for each marginal.  
m specifies the order of basis and penalty, in a basis specific manner.  
id labels the smooth. Smooths sharing a label all have the same smoothing  
parameter (assuming that they are of the same smoother type).  
by is the name of a variable by which the smooth should be multiplied (metric  
case), or each level of which should have a separate copy of the smooth  
(factor case).

  

by variables are the means for implementing ‘varying coefficient models’,  
such as that used in section 7.5.3. Suppose, for example, that we have metric  
variables x and z and want to specify a linear predictor term ‘f(xi)zi’ where
f is  
a smooth function. The model formula entry for this would be s(x,by=z).  
Only one by variable is allowed per smooth, but any smooth with multiple  
covariates (specified by s, te, ti or t2) can also have a by variable. Note  
that, provided the by variable takes more than one value, such terms are  
identifiable without a sum-to-zero constraint, and so they are left  
unconstrained.  
Metric by variables combined with a summation convention are the means  
by which linear functionals of smooths can be incorporated into the linear  
predictor. Examples are provided in sections 7.4.2 and 7.11.1. The idea is
that  
if the covariates of the smooth and the by variable are all matrices, then a  
summation across rows is implied. For example if X, Z and L are all matrices  
then s(X, Z,by=L) specifies the term Σk f(Xik, Zik)Lik in the linear
predictor.  
Tensor terms also support the convention.  
by variables also facilitate ‘smooth-factor’ interactions, in which we have a  
separate smooth of one or more covariates for each level of a factor by  
variable. For example, suppose we have metric variables x and z and factor  
variable g with three levels. Let g(i) denote the level of g corresponding to  
observation i. Then te(z,x,by=g) would contribute the terms ‘fg(i) (xi, zi)’
to  
the model linear predictor. That is, which of three separate smooth functions
of  
x and z contributes to the linear predictor depends on which of the three
levels  
of g applies for observation i. Again s, te, ti or t2 terms all work in the  
same way regardless of the number of their covariates. To avoid confounding  
problems the smooths are all subject to sum to zero constraints, which usually  
means that the main effect of g should also be included in the model  
specification. For example, g + te(z, x,by=g). Factor by variables can not  
be mixed with the summation convention.† When there are several factor by  
variables then identifiability can get tricky, and it can then be useful to
employ  
ordered factor by variables. If a factor by is an ordered factor then no
smooth  
is generated for its first level.
