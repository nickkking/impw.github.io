Dear all,

Below are the rules for the final report. I believe that this will be a good
opportunity for you to experience R, R statistical packages (e.g. igraph), and
Rmarkdown. I do not expect you to write an academic paper quality report. Many
of you will continue to use these for (tens of) years in your life. Don't be
stressed. Hope you enjoy the process!

1\. Final Report in R Markdown

R Markdown

Install "rmarkdown" and "tinytex" packages on RStudio.

(<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html>)

Official guide: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html>

Another guide: <http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/>

THE ULTIMATE guide (recommended): <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>

LaTex for writing equations:

<https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/regression/RMarkdown/example.html>

2\. Below will be included in the lab session material, but just a reminder as
these are very good resources:

\- [Link-to: Ognyanova's tutorials] (<http://kateto.net/tutorials/>

-[Link-to: Package for analyzing weighted, bipartite, longitudinal network] (<https://toreopsahl.com/tnet/>)

\- [Link-to: Bipartite network analysis
tutorial](<https://rpubs.com/pjmurphy/317838>)

\- [Link-to: Entire list of `igraph` functions](<https://igraph.org/r/doc/>)

3\. FORMAT: Please check this zipped file for an example report format:

<https://www.dropbox.com/s/eksou9lsxdxgwh1/Rmd.zip?dl=0>

You need to write your report in Rmd format. It is very convenient and easy to
use! You only need to replace the section contents of the Rmd file attached.

4\. DATA: The most convenient way to find a dataset is browsing one of the
websites introduced:

Index of Complex Networks <https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks>

Network Repository <http://networkrepository.com/>

Stanford Network Analysis Project (most of these are too large
unfortunately)聽<http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html>

But, of course, you are more than welcome to analyze any dataset that you
could find on the web or the one you collected on your own. Any dataset is
fine as long as your research question is related to social sciences and the
dataset was not used in the class.

5\. DEADLINE: The deadline for the report is the midnight of January 20th.
This is a FIRM deadline. There will be no extension.

6\. SUBMISSION:

6.1. The title of your file must be: e.g. ##.Rmd and ##.html and the zipped
file should be named ##.zip as well. ## is your last name.

6.2. The title of your email should be [NAG] ## . ## is your last name.

7\. I will upload the videos and materials for weeks 13 and 14 before the end
of this year for your reference.
